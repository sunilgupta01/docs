Java SE 8 added two packages for bulk data processing
  java.util.stream (a stream is like an iterator, but with a lot of extra functionality)
  java.util.function

Basic Syntax of Lambda Expressions
  (parameters) ->expression
  or
  (parameters) ->{ statements; }
  
Examples
1.  () -> 5                           		// takes no value and returns 5
2.  x -> 2 * x            					// takes a number and returns the result of doubling it
3.  (x, y) -> x â€“ y                     		// takes two numbers and returns their difference
4.  (int x, int y) -> x + y      				// takes two integers and returns their sum
5.  (String s) -> System.out.print(s) 		// takes a string and prints it to console without returning anything

Use Cases
  looping using forEach() - Stream package
